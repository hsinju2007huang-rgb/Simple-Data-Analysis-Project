# Simple-Data-Analysis-Project
I will be analysing academic grades of students through provided data and drawing conclusions.
Investigation: How various factors affect a student's exam scores.

Summary:
From the other file provided, I basically removed all the non-numerical columns first as well as the columns that are more complicated to analyse.
My main tool source that I used to draw relationships is pandas, where I try to find the product correlation coefficiient of various factors with exam scores.
In the end, I concluded productivity score and focus index are the strongest factors to affect student's exam scores.
Scatter diagrams are plotted at the end for reference.
